\section{Type Safe OpenCL Kernel Execution}

Now that we have described phantom types, we are ready to describe
our implementation of SmlCL.

The fullSmlCL exposes the following functions:

\begin{description}
  \item[\texttt{init}] \hfill \\ Initiates a GPU device and returns a value of
    the type \texttt{machine}, which is used to execute commands to
    the device.
  \item[\texttt{Real} and \texttt{Int}] \hfill \\ Returns a type variable of
    type \texttt{$\alpha$ T} (instantiated with the corresponding
    types), containing closures for making, reading, and writing to
    buffers.
  \item[\texttt{mkKern1} and \texttt{mkKern2}] \hfill \\ Is used to
    compile kernels expressed using the expression generators
    described in chapter \ref{kerngen}. The functions are used to
    compile kernels that take 1 and 2 input buffers as arguments,
    respectively, in addition to an output buffer. The kernels are
    typed using phantom types, to ensure that they can only be
    executed with buffers of the correct type.
  \item[\texttt{mkBuf}, \texttt{readBuf}, and \texttt{writeBuf}]
    \hfill \\ Functions for handling buffers. We can create a new
    buffer containing the elements of an input array, read the
    contents of a buffer into an array, and write the contents of an
    array to an already existing buffer (while making sure that the
    input array is no larger than the size of the buffer).
  \item[\texttt{kcall1} and \texttt{kcall2}] \hfill \\ Executes a
    kernel. Takes a number of input buffers as arguments, and produces
    a resulting output buffer. Also takes an integer, the work size
    \texttt{n}, as argument, and assumes that the output buffer
    contains \texttt{n} elements.
\end{description}

The implementation of SmlCL takes advantage of phantom types to
ensure that programs are well typed by making the types for buffers
and kernels parameterized. Since they can only be instantiated using
\texttt{Real} and \texttt{Int}, which have types \texttt{real T} and
\texttt{int T}, respectively, they each get the appropriate type.
