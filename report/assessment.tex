\section{Assessment}

The goal of this project was to develop a Standard ML module for
parallel computations on graphical processing units. The module should
be relatively simple while still allowing users leverage the great
potential for parallel processing that GPUs have. It should also take
advantage of Standard ML's type system in order to provide additional
concerning buffers as well as generation and execution of kernels. 

The SimpleCL library and the PrimCL wrapper for Standard ML greatly
simplifies setting up an environment in which to run OpenCL kernels,
while still allowing users to make fast kernels that have greatly
increased performance compared to identical sequential program. It
lacks some of the flexibility that the full OpenCL API, but the gains
in simplicity and ease-of-use are significant.

The SmlCL module is another layer of abstraction on top of PrimCL that
guarantees type-safety and kernel correctness. Using SmlCL's kernel
generator, it is easy to create kernels that perform a number of basic
operations correctly. However, SmlCL's kernel generator capabilities
are still somewhat limited, and does not easily allow the user to take
full advantage of the GPUs parallel architecture. We do however
believe that, given certain extension to the kernel generator,
performance comparable to that of PrimCL could be achieved.
