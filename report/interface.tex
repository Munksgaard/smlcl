\section{Interfacing with OpenCL from ML}

We want to facilitate an easy and safe way to take advantage of the
computational power of GPUs. By hiding some of the complexities of
parallel computations and choosing some sane default options, we hope
to make a simple interface to OpenCL that is easily usable from
Standard ML, without divulging too much of OpenCLs internal workings.

In order to achieve this, we have built a series of abstraction layers
on top of OpenCL: \emph{SimpleCL} is a C library that provides a
simplified API to OpenCL, the first iteration of \emph{Smlcl} then
provided a dumb interface from \emph{MLton}, an implementation of Standard
ML, to SimpleCL. Building on top of Smlcl, we've added the ability to
safely generated typed kernels and execute them in a type safe manner.
