\section{Correctness and Error Handling}
\label{sec:correct}

Comprehensive unit tests of SimpleCL, PrimCL or SmlCL are beyond the
scope of this project. However, several programs, including the
performance tests shown in earlier chapters, have been written for
both SimpleCL, PrimCL and SimpleCL, testing some, if not all of the
functionality, while making sure that the output for those specific
programs are correct. This may be considered a kind of black box
testing of the functionality of our modules.

The benefit of using static type checking and phantom types in SmlCL
is that buffers given as arguments to kernels always have the correct
types. However, the size of the buffers are not statically checked,
and neither are index or offset arguments to kernel buffers. As such,
users can still create erroneous kernels that fail due to too small
buffers.
